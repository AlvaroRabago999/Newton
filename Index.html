      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="204" data-end="1035">Sir Isaac Newton, born on Christmas Day, 1642 (or January 4, 1643, in the modern calendar), in the small hamlet of Woolsthorpe in Lincolnshire, emerged from humble beginnings to become one of the most influential figures in the history of science. His father, also named Isaac Newton, died just months before his birth, leaving his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, to raise him alone. Newton was born prematurely and was so small and frail that few believed he would survive. When he was three, his mother remarried and left him in the care of his grandparents, a decision that deeply affected him and contributed to the solitary, introspective nature that would characterize his adult life. Although he did not initially excel in school, a teacher eventually recognized his potential, encouraging him to pursue more academic paths.</p>
      <p data-start="1037" data-end="1949">Newton attended The King&rsquo;s School in Grantham, where he became increasingly absorbed in mechanical devices, drawing, and simple experiments. In 1661, he entered Trinity College at Cambridge University, arriving as a subsizar, meaning he worked while studying to support himself. At Cambridge, Newton encountered the works of great thinkers such as Descartes, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. Although the university&rsquo;s official curriculum was still grounded in Aristotelian philosophy, Newton independently explored more modern mathematical and scientific ideas. His brilliance became unmistakable during the years 1665 and 1666, when an outbreak of the bubonic plague forced Cambridge to temporarily close. Newton returned to Woolsthorpe during this period—later called his &ldquo;Annus Mirabilis,&rdquo; or &ldquo;year of wonders&rdquo;—and it was there, in relative isolation, that he made some of his most groundbreaking discoveries.</p></td>

      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="1951" data-end="2691">During this extraordinarily productive period, Newton laid the foundations for calculus, a new branch of mathematics that would revolutionize the study of motion and change. He also developed early insights into the laws of motion and gravity, observations that later grew into his comprehensive theory of universal gravitation. The famous story of an apple falling from a tree may be embellished, but Newton himself confirmed that observing falling objects helped inspire his thinking about forces and planetary motion. At the same time, he was conducting experiments with prisms and light, discovering that white light is not pure but composed of a spectrum of colors. This insight would later become a major cornerstone of modern optics.</p>
      <p data-start="2693" data-end="3482">Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and quickly distinguished himself, becoming a Fellow of Trinity College and later the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Over the following decades, he expanded his work on mathematics, physics, and astronomy. His magnum opus, <em data-start="2957" data-end="3002">Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, published in 1687, unified centuries of scientific thought and introduced the three laws of motion that form the foundation of classical mechanics. In the <em data-start="3159" data-end="3170">Principia</em>, Newton demonstrated that the same force of gravity governs both falling objects on Earth and the motions of the planets in the heavens—a profound revelation that reshaped humanity&rsquo;s understanding of the universe. His work showed that nature is governed not by whim or mystery but by precise, discoverable laws.</p></td>
