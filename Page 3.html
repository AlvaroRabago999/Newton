His innovations earned him significant recognition in his lifetime: he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, later serving as its president; he was appointed Warden and then Master of the Royal Mint, where he led reforms against counterfeiting; and in 1705 he was knighted by Queen Anne, becoming Sir Isaac Newton.</p></td>

      <td colspan="4">Isaac Newton’s impact on the modern world is vast, continuing to shape science, technology, and everyday life. His laws of motion and universal gravitation remain the backbone of physics and engineering, guiding everything from spacecraft navigation to the design of vehicles and buildings. Calculus, which he co-developed, is essential in fields such as computer science, economics, medicine, and artificial intelligence. His work in optics laid the groundwork for modern lenses, telescopes, cameras, and even fiber-optic communication. Beyond specific applications, Newton’s emphasis on empirical evidence and mathematical explanation helped establish the scientific method as we practice it today, making him a foundational figure whose influence is still felt across nearly every scientific and technological advancement.</td>
